<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.joomla.org/announcements/release-news/5713-joomla-3-8-0-release.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Joomla 3.8 is here</a> with over 300 improvements!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Joomla project team has released version 3.8 with many improvements and some important security fixes.</p>
<p>The highlighted new features include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Improved Routing System</strong> provides cleaner, shorter and more friendly URLs (no more IDs) for Content, Contacts, Users, and Newsfeeds.</li>
<li><strong>Joomla 4 compatibility layer</strong> has been added to pave the way for changes that are planned for Joomla 4.0.</li>
<li><strong>Sample data is now always installable and multilingual</strong>. Up to now you could only include sample data during the initial installation of Joomla. This is no longer the case.</li>
<li><strong>Encryption support for PHP 7.2</strong>. The core encryption library supports the new<strong> sodium extension</strong> which will be added to PHP 7.2.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can learn more about these key features and other Joomla 3.8 improvements by visiting the <a href="https://www.joomla.org/3/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">What's new in Joomla 3.8</a> site.</p>
<p>Joomla 3.8 also has 2 very important security fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inadequate escaping in the LDAP authentication plugin</strong> can result into a disclosure of username and password.<br />If you are using LDAP authentication on any Joomla site, you need to upgrade to Joomla 3.8.<br /><a href="https://developer.joomla.org/security-centre/711-20170902-core-ldap-information-disclosure" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Discover more about this LDAP authentication bug</a>.</li>
<li><strong>A logic bug in a SQL query could lead to the disclosure of article intro texts</strong> when these articles are in the archived state.<br /><a href="https://developer.joomla.org/security-centre/710-20170901-core-information-disclosure" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Discover more about this SQL logic bug</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.joomlapolis.com/community-builder">Community Builder</a> 2.1.3 and all Joomlapolis add-ons work just fine with Joomla 3.8.</p>
<p>However, there are reports of other components and templates having problems. So, <strong>as always</strong>, before rushing to do a one-click Joomla upgrade on your website, <strong>take a backup</strong> and do your research with all third-party products you have installed. And before upgrading on your live site, go through the process on a cloned backup site and <strong>test</strong> before you tackle your production environment.</p>

			<title>CB Auto Actions 7.0 released with 29 new features!</title>
			<link>https://www.joomlapolis.com/news/18756-cb-auto-actions-7-0-released-with-29-new-features</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.joomlapolis.com/news/18756-cb-auto-actions-7-0-released-with-29-new-features</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://www.joomlapolis.com/images/stories/blogs/nant/newsletter/cbautoactions70_640.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.joomlapolis.com/addons/cb-auto-actions">CB Auto Actions</a> 7.0 is here!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>CB Auto Actions 7.0</strong> is a <strong>major feature rich release</strong> of the <strong>most powerful</strong> <em>making things happen without coding</em> <strong>tool available for Joomla</strong>.</p>
<p>With 29 new features this swiss army tool lets you configure almost any action imaginable to help you automate your website workflows.</p>
<p>Even with our great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v67ShgUtW0I&amp;list=PLp0puRITgC7McQcw0Sli1qfSUQGwmflzi" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CB Auto Actions videos</a>, it is sometimes difficult to explain what exactly this tool is about and do it justice.</p>
<p>In most cases it is the answer to questions like: "<em>I wish I could do ABC with Community Builder and Joomla, but I am not a developer</em>". Well, this is <strong>exactly</strong> where CB Auto Actions steps up to the task and lets you configure instead of code.</p>
<p>With <strong>42 pick and use</strong> or <strong>pick and change</strong> built-in <strong>system actions</strong>, you can <strong>simple enable some cool things</strong> (automatic login after registration and pushing events to your activity stream) we have <strong>already thought about for you</strong>.</p>
<p>Or you can configure your own actions by selecting one of the 26 action types and just filling in the gaps without any coding knowledge.</p>
<p>CB Auto Actions 7.0 has 29 new features (see discussion thread for change log). Here is a shortlist of some of our favorites:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CB Privacy Actions</strong> for CB Gallery items and CB Activity streams<br />These built-in system actions will <strong>let your users select who can see specific items</strong> in their CB Gallery or on the CB Activity streams.<br />You can see these in action on <a href="http://demo.cbdemosites.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our demo site</a> (just login and add a new activity post to see the new privacy drop down selector)<br />Note: CB Privacy and CB Activity need to be installed.</li>
<li><strong>CB GroupJive Stream</strong> and <strong>CB GroupJive Gallery</strong><br />Just enable these new system actions and <strong>get activity streams and galleries in your GroupJive groups !</strong></li>
<li><strong>Output tab for actions</strong><br />This is somewhat technical to explain. Basically this is very useful for CB Activity and coding actions in order to better format the output they produce.<br />Kyle elaborates on this in his latest blog.</li>
<li><strong>Variable Loop</strong><br />Another very powerful technical features that basically lets you loop an action based on specific characteristics of the trigger event.<br />Once again Kyle explains this functionality in his blog.</li>
<li><strong>Joomla Triggers</strong><br />CB Auto Actions can now be configured to work off of Joomla events!<br />30 Joomla triggers are now recognized in CB Auto Actions 7.0!</li>
</ul>
<p> We will be discussing these new features <strong>on the forums</strong> and in <strong>new video tutorials</strong> to help our community <strong>make new things happen</strong> with these great new features.</p>
